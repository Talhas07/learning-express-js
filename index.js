 * These functions take two main parameters. The first is the URL for this function to act upon. 
 * In this case, we are targeting '/', which is the root of our website: in this case, localhost:3000.
 * 
 * The second parameter is a function with two arguments: req, and res. 
 * req represents the request that was sent to the server; We can use this object to read data about what the client is requesting to do. 
 * res represents the response that we will send back to the client.
 * Here, we are calling a function on res to send back a response: 'Successful response.'.

 * This provides us some feedback in the console to know that our application is running.
